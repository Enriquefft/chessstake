This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project template bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Why fullstack frameworks?

### Why NextJs?

I chose NextJs among all the other frameworks mostly because of its popularity, which helps team onboarding.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Enriquefft/next-fullstack-template.git
cd next-fullstack-template
bun install
```

#### Contributing

To contribute, install the pre-commit ([lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook)) hooks:

```bash
bunx lefthook install
```

### Database

The recommended db for prototyping is [Neon](https://neon.tech/) combined with drizzle multi-project-schema.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
